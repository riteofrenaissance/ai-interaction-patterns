## 🧭 Measurement Framework

### **Theoretical Model:**

```
R = f(N, W, S, M)

Where:
N = Intention Quality
W = Structural Awareness
S = Contemplative Patience
M = Interaction Depth
R = Outcome (🟢/🟠/🔴)
```

### **Measurement Strategy:**

| Construct | Type | When | Method |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| **N** | Self-report | Pre-interaction | AI Intentionality Scale (custom) |
| **W** | Self-report | Pre-interaction | AI Structural Awareness Scale (custom) |
| **S** | Self-report | Pre-interaction | Contemplative Patience Scale (adapted) |
| **M** | Behavioral | During interaction | Conversation logs (automated analysis) |
| **R** | Self-report | Post-interaction | Outcome scales (🟢/🟠/🔴) |

## 📊 Pre-Interaction Measures

### **1. AI Intentionality Scale (N)**

**Full Name:** AI Interaction Intentionality Scale (AIIS)  
**Construct:** Quality of user's intention when interacting with AI for self-reflection  
**Developers:** Baladi, S. (2025) - Developed for this study  
**Status:** Pilot tested (N=30), validation ongoing

---

#### **Construct Definition:**

**Intention Quality (N)** reflects three dimensions:
1. **Clarity:** How well-defined the user's search is
2. **Authenticity:** Degree of self-honesty in questions
3. **Depth-seeking:** Motivation for profound vs superficial insight

---

#### **Scale Structure:**

**Format:** 12 items, 5-point Likert scale  
**Response Options:** 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree  
**Subscales:** 3 (Clarity: 4 items, Authenticity: 4 items, Depth: 4 items)  
**Scoring:** Mean of all items (range 1-5); higher = stronger intention quality

---

#### **Items:**

**Clarity Subscale (N_Clarity):**
1. "When I interact with AI, I know exactly what I'm searching for"
2. "I have a clear sense of purpose before starting a conversation with AI"
3. "My questions to AI are well-defined in my mind"
4. "I understand what kind of help I need from AI" (R)

**Authenticity Subscale (N_Authenticity):**
5. "I am honest with myself when asking AI questions"
6. "I ask AI about things that genuinely matter to me"
7. "I don't pretend to be different when talking to AI"
8. "I explore real concerns, not hypothetical scenarios"

**Depth-Seeking Subscale (N_Depth):**
9. "I use AI to explore deep questions about myself"
10. "I'm looking for profound insights, not quick answers"
11. "I want AI to help me understand myself at a deeper level"
12. "Surface-level information is not what I seek from AI" (R)

**Note:** (R) = Reverse-scored item

---

#### **Psychometric Properties (Pilot Data, N=30):**

- **Internal Consistency:** α = 0.84 (total scale)
  - Clarity: α = 0.79
  - Authenticity: α = 0.81
  - Depth: α = 0.77
- **Test-Retest Reliability:** r = 0.72 (2 weeks, n=20)
- **Construct Validity:** 
  - Correlates with mindfulness (MAAS): r = 0.45, p < .01
  - Correlates with need for cognition: r = 0.52, p < .001

---

### **2. AI Structural Awareness Scale (W)**

**Full Name:** AI Structural and Epistemological Awareness Scale (ASEAS)  
**Construct:** Critical understanding of AI's nature, limitations, and epistemological status  
**Developers:** Baladi, S. (2025) - Developed for this study, informed by AI literacy literature  
**Status:** Pilot tested (N=30)

---

#### **Construct Definition:**

**Structural Awareness (W)** reflects understanding that:
- AI is a tool, not a conscious entity (ontological awareness)
- AI reproduces patterns from training data, not objective truth (epistemological awareness)
- AI doesn't "understand" the user as a person (relational awareness)

---

#### **Scale Structure:**

**Format:** 10 items, 5-point Likert scale  
**Response Options:** 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree  
**Subscales:** 3 (Ontological: 3 items, Epistemological: 4 items, Relational: 3 items)  
**Scoring:** Mean of all items (range 1-5); higher = greater critical awareness

---

#### **Items:**

**Ontological Awareness (W_Ontological):**
1. "AI is a sophisticated tool, not a thinking being"
2. "I don't attribute human qualities like 'understanding' to AI"
3. "AI processes information; it doesn't experience or feel"

**Epistemological Awareness (W_Epistemological):**
4. "AI reflects existing knowledge structures, not absolute truth"
5. "What AI tells me is based on patterns in its training data"
6. "AI's answers are probabilistic, not definitive"
7. "I understand that AI can reproduce biases from its data"

**Relational Awareness (W_Relational):**
8. "AI doesn't truly 'get' my unique situation"
9. "I see AI as a mirror for my thinking, not a guide"
10. "AI can help me reflect, but it doesn't understand me as a person"

---

#### **Psychometric Properties (Pilot Data):**

- **Internal Consistency:** α = 0.82
  - Ontological: α = 0.74
  - Epistemological: α = 0.79
  - Relational: α = 0.76
- **Criterion Validity:**
  - Correlates with AI literacy (self-assessed): r = 0.58, p < .001
  - Negatively correlates with anthropomorphization tendency: r = -0.41, p < .05

---

### **3. Contemplative Patience Scale (S)**

**Full Name:** Contemplative Patience in Questioning Scale (CPQS)  
**Construct:** Ability to stay with ambiguity, resist premature closure, and use AI as reflective space  
**Source:** Adapted from Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown & Ryan, 2003) + custom items  
**Developers:** Baladi, S. (2025) - Adaptation and new items

---

#### **Construct Definition:**

**Contemplative Patience (S)** reflects:
- Tolerance for sitting with unanswered questions
- Non-attachment to quick resolutions
- Using AI as a reflective tool, not problem-solver

---

#### **Scale Structure:**

**Format:** 8 items, 5-point Likert scale  
**Response Options:** 1 = Almost Never, 5 = Almost Always  
**Scoring:** Mean of all items (range 1-5); higher = greater contemplative patience

---

#### **Items:**

1. "I can sit with a question without needing an immediate answer" (Adapted from MAAS)
2. "I'm comfortable exploring ideas with AI without reaching conclusions"
3. "I use AI as a space for reflection, not just problem-solving" (Original)
4. "I don't feel rushed to get answers from AI" (Original)
5. "I can tolerate ambiguity in AI's responses" (Original)
6. "I enjoy the process of inquiry itself, not just the outcome" (Adapted)
7. "I'm patient with myself when AI doesn't give me what I expected" (Original)
8. "I view conversations with AI as an ongoing exploration" (Original)

---

#### **Psychometric Properties:**

- **Internal Consistency:** α = 0.86 (pilot, N=30)
- **Convergent Validity:**
  - Correlates with MAAS (full scale): r = 0.67, p < .001
  - Correlates with Need for Cognitive Closure (reversed): r = -0.53, p < .01
- **Source for Adapted Items:**
  - Brown, K. W., & Ryan, R. M. (2003). The benefits of being present: Mindfulness and its role in psychological well-being. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84*(4), 822-848.

---

#### **Outcome Classification Method:**

**Step 1:** Compute continuous scores for R_Treasure, R_Frustration, R_Illusion

**Step 2:** Assign primary outcome:
```r
R_outcome <- case_when(
  R_Treasure == max(R_Treasure, R_Frustration, R_Illusion) ~ "Treasure",
  R_Frustration == max(...) ~ "Frustration",
  R_Illusion == max(...) ~ "Illusion"
)
```

**Step 3:** Secondary classification (if scores close):
- If top 2 scores within 0.5 points → "Mixed" category
- E.g., R_Treasure = 3.8, R_Illusion = 3.5 → "Treasure-Illusion mixed"

---

### **7. Open-Ended Reflection Questions**

**Questions:**
1. "What were you hoping to find in this AI conversation?"
2. "How did you feel after the conversation ended?"
3. "Did the AI help you in the way you expected? Why or why not?"
4. "Describe any moment during the conversation where something 'clicked' for you (or didn't)."

**Analysis:** Qualitative thematic coding, triangulate with quantitative outcomes
