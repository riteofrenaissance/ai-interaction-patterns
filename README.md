## 🎯 Research Question

> **"Can AI help people discover their 'inner treasure' (self-insight), or do interactions lead to frustration or illusion?"**

We investigate how **user intentionality**, **critical awareness**, **contemplative patience**, and **interaction depth** predict three distinct outcomes:

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🟢 **The Treasure** | Genuine insight, clarity, self-understanding |
| 🟠 **Frustration** | Disappointment, feeling misunderstood |
| 🔴 **The Illusion** | False sense of control, dependency on AI |

---

## 📊 Theoretical Model

```
R = f(N, W, S, M)

N = Intention Quality (clarity, authenticity, depth-seeking)
W = Structural Awareness (critical understanding of AI)
S = Contemplative Patience (staying with questions)
M = Interaction Depth (behavioral engagement)
R = Outcome (🟢 Treasure / 🟠 Frustration / 🔴 Illusion)
```

## 🔬 Study Design

- **Type:** Cross-sectional observational study
- **Sample:** N = 120 regular AI users
- **Methods:** Pre-interaction surveys + logged AI conversations + post-interaction outcomes
- **Analysis:** Multinomial logistic regression + latent profile analysis

## 🎯 Expected Contributions

### **Theoretical:**
1. First empirical investigation of AI-mediated self-discovery outcomes
2. Integrates mindfulness, critical AI literacy, and HCI research
3. Proposes R=f(N,W,S,M) as generalizable framework

### **Practical:**
1. Informs AI design for supporting genuine insight
2. Develops best practices for self-reflective AI use
3. Identifies risk factors for dependency or frustration
4. Guides education on critical AI literacy

## 📚 Background

Users increasingly turn to conversational AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) not just for information, but for **self-reflection** and **personal insight**. Some report profound moments of clarity; others feel frustrated or become overly dependent. 

This study is the first to systematically investigate:
- **Why** do outcomes vary so widely?
- **What** psychological factors predict success vs frustration?
- **How** can we help users reach the "treasure" (genuine insight)?

## 🔗 Related Work

This study complements our previous research:
- **Safe Aperture RCT:** Training ambiguity tolerance ([GitHub](https://github.com/riteofrenaissance/safe-aperture-study))

Both studies investigate psychological flexibility and self-awareness, but:
- Safe Aperture = **intervention** (can we train tolerance?)
- Inner Treasure = **observation** (how do users naturally interact with AI?)
