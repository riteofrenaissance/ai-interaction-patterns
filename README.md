🎯 Research Question

"Can AI help people discover their 'inner treasure' (self-insight), or do interactions lead to frustration or illusion?"

We investigate how user intentionality, critical awareness, contemplative patience, and interaction depth predict three distinct outcomes:

Outcome Description
🟢 The Treasure Genuine insight, clarity, self-understanding
🟠 Frustration Disappointment, feeling misunderstood
🔴 The Illusion False sense of control, dependency on AI

---

📊 Theoretical Model

```
R = f(N, W, S, M)

N = Intention Quality (clarity, authenticity, depth-seeking)
W = Structural Awareness (critical understanding of AI)
S = Contemplative Patience (staying with questions)
M = Interaction Depth (behavioral engagement)
R = Outcome (🟢 Treasure / 🟠 Frustration / 🔴 Illusion)
```

🔬 Study Design

· Type: Cross-sectional observational study
· Sample: N = 120 regular AI users
· Methods: Pre-interaction surveys + logged AI conversations + post-interaction outcomes
· Analysis: Multinomial logistic regression + latent profile analysis

🎯 Expected Contributions

Theoretical:

1. First empirical investigation of AI-mediated self-discovery outcomes
2. Integrates mindfulness, critical AI literacy, and HCI research
3. Proposes R=f(N,W,S,M) as generalizable framework

Practical:

1. Informs AI design for supporting genuine insight
2. Develops best practices for self-reflective AI use
3. Identifies risk factors for dependency or frustration
4. Guides education on critical AI literacy

📚 Background

Users increasingly turn to conversational AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek) not just for information, but for self-reflection and personal insight. Some report profound moments of clarity; others feel frustrated or become overly dependent.

This study is the first to systematically investigate:

· Why do outcomes vary so widely?
· What psychological factors predict success vs frustration?
· How can we help users reach the "treasure" (genuine insight)?

🔗 Related Work

This study complements our previous research:

· Safe Aperture RCT: Training ambiguity tolerance (GitHub)

Both studies investigate psychological flexibility and self-awareness, but:

· Safe Aperture = intervention (can we train tolerance?)
· AI Interaction Patterns = observation (how do users naturally interact with AI?)
