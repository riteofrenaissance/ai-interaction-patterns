## 📅 Timeline Verification

| Milestone | Date | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Protocol Development** | May 2026 | ✅ Complete |
| **Pre-registration (OSF)** | June 2026 | 🔄 Target |
| **IRB Submission** | June 2026 | ⏳ Pending |
| **IRB Approval** | June 2026 | ⏳ Awaiting |
| **Recruitment Start** | July 2026 | ⏳ Scheduled |
| **Data Collection** | July-Sept 2026 | ⏳ Scheduled |

## 🔒 Registration Integrity

### **Immutability Guarantees:**
- ✅ OSF registration timestamped and locked after submission
- ✅ GitHub version control preserves all changes
- ✅ Any post-registration deviations will be documented

### **Deviation Policy:**
If protocol changes occur after registration:
1. Document in "Deviations from Pre-registration" section
2. Provide justification
3. Distinguish confirmatory vs exploratory analyses
4. Original pre-registration remains visible

## 📊 What Happens Next

### **Before Data Collection (June 2026):**
- [ ] Complete OSF pre-registration
- [ ] Obtain IRB approval
- [ ] Finalize recruitment materials
- [ ] Test data collection platform (Qualtrics/REDCap)
- [ ] Pilot test full procedure (N=5-10)

### **During Data Collection (July-Sept 2026):**
- [ ] Monitor recruitment progress (target N=120)
- [ ] Track completion rates
- [ ] Conduct quality checks (attention checks, genuine engagement)
- [ ] Maintain participant log
- [ ] Document any issues

### **After Data Collection (Oct-Nov 2026):**

## ⚠️ Limitations Acknowledged

### **Pre-registered Limitations:**

**1. Self-Selection Bias:**
- Volunteers may differ from general AI users
- Documented via demographics

**2. Single Time Point:**
- Cross-sectional, not longitudinal
- Cannot establish causation definitively

**3. Self-Report Outcomes:**
- R (outcome) is subjective
- Triangulated with qualitative data

**4. Custom Scales:**
- N, W, S, R not fully validated
- Pilot data (N=30) provides initial evidence
- Full validation with N=120

**5. Platform Variability:**
- ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot may differ
- Controlled in analysis if needed

## 📚 Relationship to Other Studies

### **Safe Aperture RCT:**
- **Repository:** https://github.com/riteofrenaissance/safe-aperture-study
- **Relationship:** Complementary but independent
  - Safe Aperture = **intervention** study (ambiguity tolerance training)
  - AI Patterns = **observational** study (natural AI interaction)
- **Data:** Completely separate datasets
- **Timeline:** Safe Aperture (Dec 2025-May 2026), AI Patterns (July-Dec 2026)

**No data overlap or dependencies between studies.**
